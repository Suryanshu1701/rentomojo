Hello,
I had no clue or experience of Node js before this project.
I have learnt Node JS and created this project within these two days.

Instruction to follow before running:

1.change the database details ,ie, change the "username"  and "server address" of the databases in the file "crawler.js"  of project.
2.chanage the password of database according to your database.


The project should function after these changes and didplays three columns namely:
1.The urls visted
2.The count of references of that url.
3.The list of parameters associated witn each of reference.
